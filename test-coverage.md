It brings code coverage analysis directly into the Eclipse workbench:

- **Fast develop/test cycle**: Launches from within the workbench like JUnit test runs can directly be analyzed for code coverage.
- **Rich coverage analysis**: Coverage results are immediately summarized and highlighted in the Java source code editors.
- **Non-invasive**: EclEmma does not require modifying your projects or performing any other setup.

### Code Coverage (.NET, Microsoft)

To determine what proportion of your project's code is actually being tested by coded tests such as unit tests, you can use the code coverage feature of Visual Studio. 
To guard effectively against bugs, your tests should exercise or 'cover' a large proportion of your code.
