## Ruby

**Minitest** : minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking. "I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week and we were allowed to choose our testing frameworks. 
Kirk Haines and I were paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test frameworks...https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/testing_frameworks
